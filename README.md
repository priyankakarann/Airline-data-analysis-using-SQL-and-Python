# Airline Data Analysis Using SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline data using SQL queries to gain insights into flight operations, delays, and passenger trends. The dataset includes flight records, airport information, and delay statistics to help understand patterns in airline performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of real-world airline operations data, including:
- Flight details such as airline, flight number, origin, and destination.
- Departure and arrival times.
- Delay reasons and durations.
- Passenger traffic and airline performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL (depending on user preference)
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Airline_data_analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install jupyter pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the `Airline_data_analysis_using_sql.ipynb` file.

## Data Cleaning and Validation
- Removed missing or duplicate values to ensure data integrity.
- Standardized date and time formats for consistency.
- Validated airport codes and airline names against official records.
- Checked for anomalies in flight delay records and corrected inconsistencies.

## Data Analysis
- **Flight Delays:** Identified the factors contributing to delays, such as weather, air traffic, and operational issues.
- **Airline Performance:** Compared on-time performance across different airlines.
- **Passenger Trends:** Analyzed peak travel seasons and high-demand routes.
- **Airport Congestion:** Evaluated the busiest airports and their impact on scheduling.

## Data Visualization
- **Bar Charts:** Distribution of flight delays per airline.
- **Line Graphs:** Trends in delays over time.
- **Heatmaps:** Correlation between delay reasons and time of the day.
- **Scatter Plots:** Relationship between flight duration and delays.

## Key Insights
- Analyzed the impact of weather and operational factors on flight delays.
- Identified the most and least punctual airlines.
- Examined seasonal flight trends and passenger travel patterns.
- Assessed airport congestion levels and their effect on flight schedules.

## Usage
Users can modify and execute the SQL queries in the notebook to explore airline trends further. Additional queries can be added to analyze specific performance metrics or operational issues. The visualizations provide a clearer understanding of trends and correlations in the dataset.
